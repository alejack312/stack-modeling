# Questions
#### What tradeoffs did you make in choosing your representation? What else did you try that didnâ€™t work as well?
We modeled relationships (like inheritance, associations, and architectural links) 
as explicit relations or fields, which makes constraints easy to express. With that
being said, instances can be very verbose and their visualizations cluttered.
Cope-and-Drag has helped to somewhat offset this effect.

For inheritance and interface implementation, we chose to let classes reference 
interfaces directly, rather than having interfaces track what classes are 
implementing them, in order to better support multiple inheritance and avoid redundancy.

Upon adding the fields and methods sig to classes, all other visualizations got 
very crowded. Therefore, we had to create an AbstractClass sig and extend it to 
create a SimpleClass sig and an ExtendedClass sig late into development.

#### What assumptions did you make about scope? What are the limits of your model?
The model focuses on structural properties and does not capture behaviors or 
dynamic instances which would be encapsulated by temporal Forge. Some architectural 
features, like per-client data links in transformations, are simplified for 
clarity. The model does not cover all possible architectural styles or design 
patterns, instead focusing on a representative subset.

The model enforces acyclicity in inheritance and some associations, which may 
not capture all real-world edge cases. 

Optional or partial links are not well represented. 

Each architectural style is modeled independently. The model can run with complex 
architectures, however, to preserve clean visualizations, we ran them separately
as well as we could.

#### Did your goals change at all from your proposal? Did you realize anything you planned was unrealistic, or that anything you thought was unrealistic was doable?
Initially, we were modeling technology stacks for software projects. Each stack 
included various components (frontend, backend, database, ORM, authentication) 
along with relevant quality attributes like Speed, Security, and Reliability. 
In theory, by modeling these relationships, we can analyze trade-offs and detect 
potential technological conflicts or limitations.

This proposal was a continuation of a Curiosity Modeling project. We choose to 
model software architectures out of an interest to model potential stacks a 
developer can choose from depending on their use case. For example, there was a 
predicate that takes in a set of qualities and will produce a stack with those 
qualities. Ultimately, we seek to showcase the options developers and engineers 
have at their disposal for creation.

After meeting with our mentor TA, we decided to shift to a more focused project.
The initial proposal attempted to cover much ground, and it was relatively simple
in terms of Forge modeling. We chose to pivot to modeling the satisfiability of 
graphical representations of software architecture. After researching the topic, 
we found an incredibly useful paper which led much of our Forge modeling.

#### How should we understand an instance of your model and what your visualization shows (whether custom or default)?
Each instance generated by Forge represents a possible architecture or design 
pattern that satisfies the specified constraints. 

The default visualization shows the sigs and their relationships, such as which 
clients are connected to which servers, or how tasks are connected in a 
pipe-and-filter system. It showcases associations between classes, root and 
hierarchy structures, inheritance relationships (single and multiple), models of
design patterns and the implementation of interfaces.

For transformation predicates, an instance shows a before-and-after pair, 
illustrating how the architecture changes according to the transformation rules.

The visualization helps demonstrate the verification of a graph grammar for a particular
software architecture representation. Furthermore, with transformations and 
multiple inheritance resolution, it showcases that it was possible to either
model a successful transformation or resolve an instance of an inheritance
conflict successfully.

## Design choices

**High-Level Design**
Our project models software architecture styles and design patterns using Relational  
Forge language. The codebase is organized around architectural styles
(client-server, distributed, pipe-and-filter), inheritance and interface
relationships, design patterns (composite, decorator), association/aggregation/composition
relationships, and root and hierarchy structures.

Each architectural or design concept is represented as a set of signatures
(sigs) and predicates that capture the structural and behavioral constraints of
the style or pattern.

**Relationships between Sigs and Predicates**

- Sigs represent the core entities in the architecture, such as `Class`,
  `Interface`, `Client`, `Server`, `Data`, `Task`, `Str`, `Composite`, and `Decorator`.
- Predicates encode the rules and constraints that define valid instances of these entities and their relationships. For example
  `inheritanceConstraints` enforces valid inheritance hierarchies, `pipeFilterStructure` defines valid pipe-and-filter graphs, and `compositeStructure` encodes the composite design pattern.
- Transformation predicates (e.g., `transform`, `transformPF`) model architectural rewrites, such as converting a client-server
  architecture to a distributed one or adding feedback to a pipe-and-filter system.

**Data Structures and Modeling Choices**


- We use sets and relations in sigs to model associations (e.g., `childrenC: set Component` in `Composite`, `ds: set Data` in `Client`).
- Abstract sigs and inheritance are used to capture generalization (e.g., `abstract sig Server {}`, `one sig Ctrl extends Server {}`).
- Functional and partial functional relations (e.g., `parentOrder: pfunc Class -> Int`) are used to model ordering and policies in inheritance.
- The use of `one`, `set`, and `lone` multiplicities allows us to precisely control the allowed cardinalities in the model.
- Predicates are composed modularly, so that constraints can be reused and combined for different runs and tests.

## Notes and Design Choices from the Codebase

Throughout the codebase, we have included several notes and design checks to clarify modeling decisions and highlight important considerations:

- **Interfaces and Implementers**: We chose to remove the implementer field from the Interface sig and instead let each Class sig have a set of interfaces it implements. This enables modeling multiple interface inheritance, as in Java, and avoids redundancy.

- **Redundant Inheritance**: We identified and addressed the problem of redundant inheritance, where a class could inherit from both a parent and a grandparent simultaneously. The `noRedundantInheritance` predicate ensures that a class cannot inherit from both a parent and its ancestor, maintaining a clean hierarchy.

- **Generalization Hierarchy**: The model enforces that inheritance relationships flow from general to specific, reflecting UML semantics. This is discussed in the comments for the `generalization` predicate.

- **Interface Multiplicity**: The model restricts each class to implement at most one interface (or none), as specified in the `interfaceMultiplicity` predicate. This is based on a production from the referenced research paper.

- **Resolution Policies for Multiple Inheritance**: We explored different resolution policies (LeftWins, RightWins, RequireOverride, MergeAll) for handling method and field conflicts in multiple inheritance scenarios. The `resolution` predicate encodes these policies, and comments explain the intended behavior for each.

- **RequireOverride Policy**: For this policy, if two parents share a method, the subclass must declare its own version. This is explicitly noted in the comments, and the model enforces that the subclass's methodsC set must include the conflicting method.

- **Data Structures**: The use of sets, relations, and multiplicities (one, set, lone) is intentional to precisely capture associations, generalizations, and constraints in the architecture.

- **Transformation Modeling**: The transformation predicates are designed to model architectural rewrites, and comments clarify the need for per-client data links and the preservation of client counts across transformations.

- **Testing and Modularity**: Predicates are composed modularly, and the codebase includes extensive test suites to ensure that each design choice and constraint is properly enforced and can be independently verified.

These notes and design checks are present as comments in the `.frg` files and serve both as documentation and as a guide for future extensions or modifications to the model.

## Errors/Bugs

**Reproduction Steps for Known Issues:**

- If a referenced field is not declared in a sig (e.g., using `dsB` in a predicate without declaring it in `BC`), Forge will report an "unbound identifier" error. To reproduce: remove or misspell a field in a sig and reference it in a predicate.
- If the transformation predicates are unsatisfiable (e.g., due to missing Data instances or incorrect modeling of per-client data links), running the corresponding `run` command will fail to produce an instance. To reproduce: run `runTransform` with insufficient Data or without modeling per-client data links in `BC`/`AC`.
- If the pipe-and-filter and client-server logic are not connected, removing one will not affect the other, but unsatisfiability may still occur due to unrelated modeling issues.

## Tests

**Testing Suites**

- The codebase includes extensive test suites (see `architecture.test.frg`, `inheritance.test.frg`, `design-pattern.test.frg`) that
  assert key properties of each architectural style, inheritance model, and design pattern.
- Each test suite uses `assert` statements to check that the model admits valid instances and rejects invalid ones (e.g., no
  self-inheritance, correct method resolution, valid composite/decorator structures).
- Example instances are provided to illustrate both valid and invalid configurations for design patterns.

**How to Run the Tests**

- Open the relevant `.frg` test file in the Forge IDE or compatible tool.
- Use the `run` or `assert` commands provided in the test suites to check the model. For example, run `runClientServerArchitecture` or
  the named test suites in the test files.
- The output will indicate whether the assertions are satisfiable (valid) or unsatisfiable (invalid), helping to verify the correctness
  of the model.
